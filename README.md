# App-Click-through-Rate-CTR-

--Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

--Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.--

--using ROUND, SUM, CASE WHEN function--


SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 *
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2)  AS ctr_rate
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' 
  AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
